# Docker for Developers

## Purpose

Setting up new developers is a pain, and making sure everyone's development environment is running under the same assumptions is a full time job. On top of that, once set up the developer can be free of dependencies such as network connectivity and shared data stores. Another big benefit is that any version upgrades that need to be tested can easily be reverted instead of trying to make sure all of your local system's settings are back to normal.

## Running

 - Install Docker
 - Clone the repository
 - Run `docker-compose up`

Voila!
